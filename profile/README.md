## [![Hestia](/.internals/banners/hestia_105x25.svg)](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/Hestia) Libraries

[![Chew Kean Ho](/.internals/banners/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

My super libraries focusing on providing highest consistencies across
multiple selected programming languages for stability and cross platform
usability. These libraries were written from scratch with 3 solid purposes:

1. Make sure cross-compilation across platforms and architectures can be done
   from anywhere to anywhere.
2. Make sure the algorithm is the same across multiple programming languages.
3. Make sure the libraries are decentralized, re-distributable, and its
   supply chain unaffected by geo-political shenanigans or a single business
   unit opression.

> **WHY HESTIA?**
>
> Like the mythology, I just want a peaceful library free from all the software
> industry's drama and friendly to others.
>
> We rarely heard about
> [Hestia (or Vesta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia) among the Olympus
> stories and dramas but she's there taking care everyone, steadily, and
> quietly. She is there making sure there's always a place to take rest and
> have warmth regardless who they are, what they are, or what they been through.
