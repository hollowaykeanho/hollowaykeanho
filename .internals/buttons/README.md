# Button Design Synchonization

This is a maintainer note for future button creation. Use Inkscape and make sure
the badge is saved as `plain SVG` format (**NOT the default** `Inkscape SVG`
format).




## Button

1. Select a compatible background color value based on the brand guidelines or
   closest. The color **MUST IMMUNE TO** dark/light presentations.




## Value

1. Shift value align to the right with the button background to 0.
2. Reduce value's x-axis by 10.
3. Set value's height to 18 for single line. Multiple lines should preserve
   similar text height.
4. Vertically center the value. If the value contains tailing alphabet (e.g. 'g'
   and 'y'). Manually lower the centering so that it is correctly perceived.




## Brand Logo

1. Set brand logo x-axis to 20.
2. Vertically center the brand logo.
3. No modification to the logo elements for trademark compliances.
